### Features

The project doesn't cover the following features, owing to a shortage of time.

1. The initial plan was to use a third party library for styling such as Tailwind or Material JS, but have used basic CSS owing to a time crunch.
2. Did not have time to beautify the app, so, the styling is very basic.
3. Have gone for a mobile first approach. Did not get a chance to style the components fully in desktop view.
